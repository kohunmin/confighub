# ConfigHub

A unified dashboard for managing AI coding tool configurations in one place.

## Overview

ConfigHub lets you view, edit, compare, and sync configuration files for **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, and **Devin** — all from a single VS Code-style dark UI running locally on your machine.

## Features

### ✏️ Edit
Browse and edit each tool's config files directly in a Monaco editor (the same editor as VS Code):

| Section | Claude Code | Cursor | Windsurf | Devin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MCP Servers | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` | — | `~/.config/cognition/config.json` |
| Agent Rules | `CLAUDE.md` | `.cursor/rules/*.md` | `.windsurf/rules/*.md` | `AGENTS.md` |
| Skills | `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/...` | — | — | `.cognition/skills/` |
| Settings | `~/.claude/settings.json` | `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/settings.json` | — | — |

### ↕️ Sync
Copy MCP server configs from one tool to all others with the **↕ Apply All** button. Only the `mcpServers` key is replaced — other keys (like Claude's `preferences`) are preserved.

### ⚠️ Diff Detection
Yellow warning badges appear on any section where configs differ between tools. Works for both JSON (structural diff) and Markdown (text diff).

### 📊 Compare Panel
Expand the bottom panel to see a side-by-side table of MCP server differences across all tools, or a Monaco diff editor for Markdown rule files.

### 💾 Auto Backup
Every save creates a `.bak.timestamp` file next to the original, so you can always roll back.

### ↔️ Resizable Sidebar
Drag the handle between the sidebar and editor to resize. Width is saved to `localStorage`.

## Getting Started

### Option 1 — Run instantly with npx (no install needed)

```bash
npx confighub
```

The first run builds the app (~30 seconds). Subsequent runs start instantly. ConfigHub opens automatically in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Use a custom port:
```bash
PORT=4000 npx confighub
```

### Option 2 — Clone and run from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kohunmin/confighub.git
cd confighub
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — it redirects automatically to the Claude Code MCP view.

> **Note:** The app reads and writes real config files on your local filesystem via Next.js API routes. No data leaves your machine.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14+** (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- **Monaco Editor** (`@monaco-editor/react`) — VS Code dark theme
- **deep-diff** + **diff** — JSON structural diff and unified text diff
- **gray-matter** — YAML frontmatter parsing for `SKILL.md` files
- Node.js `fs` in API routes for real file I/O
